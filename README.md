# Secure-Web-Server
Seneca Project

This assignment required us to create a secure web application using a programming language of our choice. The Web application needed to have a nice home page with 2 links. Each link prompted the user to log in to gain access to one of two simple data search pages. These pages searched for relevant data where the user can put in various simple form based queries, populating the list from an sql database.

We used Apache web server on centOS virtualbox. We used a MySql database and the website was coded in php. Bootstrap was also used to simplify the cosmetic code of the website.

### What I learned

- I learned a lot about web server security topics such as host hardening and SQL injection. 

- I gained experience creating an SQL database to communicate with a secure web application.

- I gained experience in using PHP to create secure user accounts and forms.

- I learned about hashing and other methods of securing passwords and data in transit.
